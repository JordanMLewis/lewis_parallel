The timing data is tricky to understand and differences in timing may due to several factors.
Since we added the convergence check to the code to stop executing after a certain threshold,
I would expect there to be less variation in execution times as we see below.

It is interesting to me that the 1000 dimension test was much faster than the 100 dimension test.
Perhaps it is because values will converge quicker. The trend does not continue with 5000 cells
however, as the time needed to allocate space and check for convergence outweighs other speedups.

with p=4, I assume that because the decomposed parts are a bit larger, it takes more time than when
p=9. 

Timing data measured using "time" program.

	p=1	p=4	p=9
n=100	1.021s	2.324s	1.086s
n=1000	0.530s	0.555s	0.644s
n=5000	2.859s	1.232s	1.057s
